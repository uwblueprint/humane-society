# Oakville and Milton Humane Society üêæ
The Oakville and Milton Humane Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and improving the life of animals within the community and connecting them to the communities that care about them in Oakville and Milton. We will be developing a web application that allows volunteers to sign up for pet-sitting tasks, enabling volunteers to efficiently care for multiple animals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Install Docker Desktop ([MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) | [Windows (Home)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/) | [Windows (Pro, Enterprise, Education)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) | [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server)) and ensure that it is running


### Set up

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the project folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uwblueprint/humane-society.git
cd humane-society
```
2. Follow steps in the Secrets section (below) to ensure that you have the following files added to your repository, with the correct environment variables set:

- `.env`
- `frontend/.env`

3. Run the application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
```bash
docker exec -it humane_society_backend /bin/bash -c "node migrate up"
```

### Secrets

- Create A [HashiCorp Cloud Platform Account](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in?ajs_aid=9085f07d-f411-42b4-855b-72795f4fdbcc&product_intent=vault)
- Make sure you have been added to the [Humane Society HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/uwblueprint/).
- Install [HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-secrets/hcp-vault-secrets-install-cli#install-hcp-vault-secrets-cli) in order to pull secrets
- In the folder where you cloned the Humane Society repository, log into Vault

```bash
hcp auth login
```

- Configure the Vault Command Line Interface

```bash
hcp profile init
```

- Select the `humane-society` Organization/Project/Application.

```bash
‚úî Organization with name "humane-society" and ID "b357b214-2c48-4e87-b7b6-0e51f3902ac0" selected
‚úî Project with name "humane-society" and ID "e841cbab-9210-4fd8-8341-a07946852120" selected
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê
? Select an application name:
  ‚ñ∏ humane-society
  ‚ñ∏ humane-society-frontend
```

### Copying secrets from the vault to local

- Copy secrets to a `.env` and `/frontend/.env` file

```bash
./setup_secrets.sh
```

### Sending all local secrets to the vault (warning: this overwrites all secrets)

- Push secrets from `.env` and `/frontend/.env` file to HashiCorp Vault

```bash
./push_secrets.sh
```

## Useful Commands

### Get Names & Statuses of Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```

### Accessing PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# run a bash shell in the container
docker exec -it humane_society_db /bin/bash

# in container now
psql -U postgres -d humane_society_dev

# in postgres shell, some common commands:
# display all table names
\dt
# quit
\q
# you can run any SQL query, don't forget the semicolon!
SELECT * FROM <table-name>;
```

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
# linting & formatting warnings only
docker exec -it humane_society_backend /bin/bash -c "yarn run lint"
docker exec -it humane_society_frontend /bin/bash -c "yarn run lint"

# linting with fix & formatting
docker exec -it humane_society_backend /bin/bash -c "yarn run fix"
docker exec -it humane_society_frontend /bin/bash -c "yarn run fix"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
docker exec -it humane_society_backend /bin/bash -c "yarn test"
```


## Version Control Guide

### Branching
* Branch off of `main` for all feature work and bug fixes, creating a "feature branch". Prefix the feature branch name with your name. The branch name should be in kebab case and it should be short and descriptive. E.g. `annie/readme-update`
* To integrate changes on `main` into your feature branch, **use rebase instead of merge**

```bash
# currently working on feature branch, there are new commits on main
git pull origin main --rebase

# if there are conflicts, resolve them and then:
git add .
git rebase --continue

# force push to remote feature branch
git push -f
```

### Commits
* Commits should be atomic (guideline: the commit is self-contained; a reviewer could make sense of it even if they viewed the commit diff in isolation)
* Trivial commits (e.g. fixing a typo in the previous commit, formatting changes) should be squashed or fixup'd into the last non-trivial commit

```bash
# last commit contained a typo, fixed now
git add .
git commit -m "fixes typo"

# fixup into previous commit through interactive rebase
# x in HEAD~x refers to the last x commits you want to view
git rebase -i HEAD~2
# text editor opens, follow instructions in there to fixup

# force push to remote feature branch
git push -f
```

* Commit messages and PR names are descriptive and written in **imperative tense**<sup>1</sup>. E.g. "create user REST endpoints", not "created user REST endpoints"
* PRs can contain multiple commits, they do not need to be squashed together before merging as long as each commit is atomic. Our repo is configured to only allow squash commits to `main` so the entire PR will appear as 1 commit on `main`, but the individual commits are preserved when viewing the PR.
